For the short sample, we tested the short_sample.txt by hand to determine how the algorithm should be implemented and used it as a second check as well to make sure our implementation matches the expected.

Worked at least 4 hours sychronously doing pair programming and few hours asychronously. 

(Saif): I personally used the Visual Studio 2019 Debugger a lot, along with breakpoints (especially situated at if-else statements and for-loops) and watch lists, to keep track of variables and to ensure that the algorithm is correct on a much lower level of scope.

(Saif): I worked at least 10-15 hours on this lab trying to debug and fix errors, definitely more than actually coding the algorithm itself.

(Sizhe): Worked about at least 8 hours due to the function analyze_segments being easier. At the beginning Saif allocate the stuff each person should do before the meeting, he asked me to do the analyzer one and what I can do is finish the analyzer with few bugs. Saif did a lot of debugging indeed. i do state my intend that i want to do the calculate score part.

(Saif): I did approximately 75% of the work (debugged mostly calculate_score, string outputs to main.c and part of analyze_segments), and Sizhe helped out quite a lot as well with providing suggestions and in peer programming in general.
        We both collaborated on writing a function called sameacid that would take the sample codon's index and candidate codon's index as parameters
        and return 1 if both codons correspond to the same amino acid and 0 otherwise, though Gradescope prevented us from doing so because it caused errors in the submission even though it worked fine in Visual Studio 2019.
